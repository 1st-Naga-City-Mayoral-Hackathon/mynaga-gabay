# This repo is a monorepo. When deploying the Python AI service on Railway,
# we want the build context to include only `packages/ai` and ignore the
# root Dockerfile / Node workspaces (which can trigger Railway security scans).

# Ignore the root Dockerfile (it's for deploying the Next.js web image)
