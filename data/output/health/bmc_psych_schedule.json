It is based on the understanding that children often communicate and process their experiences through play, as it is a natural medium for them to explore their thoughts and feelings. Therapeutic play can involve various techniques such as art, storytelling, puppetry, role-playing, and games, facilitated by trained therapists or mental health professionals. The goal is to provide a safe and supportive environment where children can freely express themselves, build self-esteem, learn problem-solving skills, and develop healthier ways of interacting with others.
